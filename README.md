# 📊 Semiconductor Yield Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict Pass/Fail yield in a semiconductor manufacturing process using sensor signal data.

## 🧠 Project Overview
Modern semiconductor manufacturing involves hundreds of sensor signals. Not all signals are useful. This project focuses on identifying the most important features and using them to build accurate yield prediction models.

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict semiconductor yield (Pass / Fail)
- Reduce dimensionality using feature selection
- Improve model performance and interpretability

## 📂 Project Files
